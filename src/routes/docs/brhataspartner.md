As the application of IKS throughout curricula is essential to the preservation of our civilizational memory, Bṛhat hopes to play a part in its implementation. We, at Bṛhat, understand the complexity involved in this herculean task. It would be impossible for a small institution like Bṛhat to focus on all aspects of Indian curricula; thus, we wish to concentrate our efforts on the subjects in which we have expertise. 

We wish to partner with the government and other organizations on IKS implementation, participate in various programs, and undertake awareness activities.  Because the IKS (Indian Knowledge System) is critical to reimagining how multiple strands of knowledge are viewed, Bṛhat intends to work in the following areas to aid in the implementation of the IKS.
