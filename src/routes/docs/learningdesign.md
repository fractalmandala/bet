IKS integration and implementation would not be possible without thinking about it fromthinking it from a design perspective. An IKS based design that provides pillars to any IKS course. 

Bṛhat envisages itself as a nodal agency, helping institutions digitize their curriculum and pedagogies, and also introducing learning designs that are compatible with IKS thinking. In addition to assisting institutions and organizations with the incorporation of IKS into their daily operations, Bṛhat wants to create in-house expertise in education, psychology, political-comparative philosophy and public policy. These three topics are central to Bṛhat's work and are therefore given priority for IKS redesign.
